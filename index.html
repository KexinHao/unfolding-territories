          <h3>Loosely</h3>
          <p>Works that serve as a tool to question what is now too ephemeral to grasp. This island is a place for speculative fabrications and delicious ambiguity.. It is less about the statements and more about the questions. Present in the moment, while asking where we are heading. What are the implications of the past while facing the uncertainty of not knowing? We are not trying to predict, but rather have the chance to intervene with shaping the future or giving meaning to the past. </p>

          <h3>Otherly</h3>
          <p>This Island accommodates the projects which aim at understanding and integrating an inclusive notion of otherness. One in which the “other” is not being categorized under binary frameworks, described with oppositional structures, but rather seen as part of regenerative, perpetual conversation. Projects which aren’t afraid of encountering differences and being repositioned by it. Can we help each other to find a place of belonging, connecting through a shared space and shared moment? </p>
