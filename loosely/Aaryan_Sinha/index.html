            These images were made over the span of the last 2 years, in various places and in many states of mind. They represent a search for something, while the something remains uncertain. A search that had already begun back in 2019, when i first moved to the Netherlands, leaving my comfort zone back in New Delhi, India. The ongoing subconscious search led to a realization, a realization and a longing. A realization that I do not belong and a longing to belong. Many confrontational questions arose as a result, questions that remain unanswered to this day, and will perhaps continue to be so.
            <br />
            These are questions about my identity, my identity as an Indian, my identity as a brown person in a western white world.
            <br />
            These are questions about home, about what makes a home, about the feeling of home.
            <br />
            These are questions about my privilege, abut my sense of freedom.
            <br />
            There are so many unanswered questions.
            <br />
            These images represent my state of mind in a way, the feeling of not belonging, the feeling of being stuck in no mans land, in the middle of 2 places, 2 worlds. They are meant to visualize something that can not be visualized. They are supposed to represent a search for something, while the something remains uncertain.

            My name is Aaryan Sinha. With my photographic practice, I tend to work on topics relating to my homeland of India and my identity in relation to that. Having lived in a Western society for over 2 years now, I am more and more intrigued and inspired by the roots I come from, while still acknowledging the path i am walking on. Photography as a medium along with text and archival work gives me the opportunity to observe and question topics that arise as i grow older in relation to my identity. While also allowing me to work on complex societal issues such as the acts of injustice and violence revolving around the marginalised sections of society both in India and around the world. With regards to my images, they are mainly observations that i make, in old and new places that i come across to, observing the details that i find intriguing in the landscapes, details of human traces. I find that my images are often open for interpretation, with the text sort of acting like an anchor, guiding the viewer through the story i am trying to portray.
