            over the last years, i noticed that we are losing connection
            <br />with each other and what is around us
            <br />
            <br />our pace is increasing and accessibility is changing,
            <br />because we are constantly connected digitally
            <br />giving us many possibilities to choose from, at every moment
            <br />
            <br />i want to appreciate the simple things again, re-connect,
            <br />find beauty in what already exists and always will be,
            <br />forever and everywhere.
          </p>
          <p id="work-description">
            The amount of input we are, as a collective body and as individuals, are receiving every moment of time, has increased drastically over the last couple of decennia. Although the human brain is very adaptive, I believe it is too much to handle. We have become disconnected from each other and our environment. In the rapidly evolving, goal-orientated western society, everything needs to be at our disposal at any given moment, and we have forgotten to appreciate. I want to allow the viewer to slow down and take their time again, to find their peace of mind.
            <br />In my youth, I have spent a lot of time outside, as I was often playing in the midst of animals or in the woods. Only as a teenager I had my first encounter with internet. Now that I live in the city, in the midst of a fast evolving environment, it makes me feel disconnected with the sense of space and physicality I grew up in. Over the course of last year, I have found a way that allows me to find my peace of mind. In my interactive installation, I put emphasis on themes such as (re)connection, appreciation and slowing down time. I do so through my detailed examinations of what already exists everywhere in the world around us, and my other experiments with wood as a material.

            Tobias Reinbrandt de Haan (b.1993) is a visual artist based in The Hague, NL, and currently studies Documentary Photography at the Royal Academy of Art (KABK). His practice encompasses photographic, video, text and installation work, which together, are focussed on the dynamics between individuals, social structures, and the relationship between humans and nature. By paying attention to how people or cultural groups behave and interact with each other and their surroundings, he finds and depicts similarities and differences. During his projects, he works pro-active and hands-on, as he goes out to interact with its subjects. The work is meant to (re)-connect and build bridges between people, cultures and nature.Â
