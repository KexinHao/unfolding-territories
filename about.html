            The Cockroach collective is a group of 46 students infesting the landscape of photography and exploring the possibilities of the medium to go beyond traditional definitions.
            <br /><br />
            UNFOLDING TERRITORIES: 
            <br />
            Co-creating Through Cartographies of Care is a collective effort to expand the definition of care aiming at the broader understanding of what care means in the contemporary world and how art can be seen as a manifestation and tool of care. 
            <br /><br />
            The act of creation is an act of care, creating work is a movement towards expression of one's honest desire to connect with others. In our exhibition we would like to share what we care about, in the ever changing world that surrounds us. 
            <br /><br />
            We have been driven to create an an opportunity for everyone, the audience and the artists, felt seen and listened to. At our core we are guided by equality, inclusivity and respect. The willingness to take care of one another is a representative trait of our time when we all need additional support. These turbulent years are reflected in the ways we create work and the themes we explore. Furthermore, we want to challenge photography and explore it as a means of care to reflect our world today. 
            <br /><br />
            With Unfolding Territories: Co-existing Through Cartographies of Care, we create a space which carries a proposition. What if creation is an act of care?  
            <br /><br />
            You are invited to start a dialogue about what care could mean in society, betting on the idea that art can be truly transformative if it comes from a place of love, respect, and curiosity for the other.

            The projects are organised in five islands. You can imagine an archipelago of care, fluidly divided by water, where each island is in conversation with another. To navigate these waters and explore the islands, we provide you with a map but be aware, map is not a territory, a map is an artificial structure, territory is what lies beneath, the real connection we experience through care.

            Works that serve as a tool to question what is now too ephemeral to grasp. This island is a place for speculative fabrications and delicious ambiguity.. It is less about the statements and more about the questions. Present in the moment, while asking where we are heading. What are the implications of the past while facing the uncertainty of not knowing? We are not trying to predict, but rather have the chance to intervene with shaping the future or giving meaning to the past.

          This Island accommodates the projects which aim at understanding and integrating an inclusive notion of otherness. One in which the “other” is not being categorized under binary frameworks, described with oppositional structures, but rather seen as part of regenerative, perpetual conversation. Projects which aren’t afraid of encountering differences and being repositioned by it. Can we help each other to find a place of belonging, connecting through a shared space and shared moment?

            These works are dealing with delicate themes, indirectly or implicitly . Precious, carefully handled creations that invite the audience to explore subtleties of their surroundings. On this island, metaphorical and symbolic representations are an integral part of artistic expression.

            These projects zoom in exploring the topics with precision, direction and analytically investigating the world . Works on this island explore intimacy through different dimensions. Either it is an engagement with a subject of an investigation or a personal story, the definition of closeness is expanding on this island.
